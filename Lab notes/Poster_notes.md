# what I need done for the poster
A proposed Algorithm
## method:
- data collection
- flow diagram code
- why these Algorithms
-  pre-processing
- real-time simulation
- frequency analysis -> what blinks
  - kinds of blinks (sponatneous etc.)
- why first derivative
- Error (due to video and ground truth)
## results
- ROC curve for sens/spec accuracy
- comparison of algorithms:
  - transformed data with threshold
- Sliding window:
  - length, separation, Fs, timing
- multiple features: dvdt, var, hilbert etc.
  - after dvdt
    - hilbert
    - second diff etc.
  - other than dvdt
    - wavelet
    - counting zero crossings (good becuase not amplitude dependent)
- Hardware:
  - modulation
  - multiple receivers (CCD?)

conclusion
- can it be improved from simply DSP
- or will hardware need to be improved also
-
design objectives
