# What do we want to sense and why?

## Introduction

So fat, the sensicorn project has measured only one thing, the bluetooth signal strength of the badges that we all wore[1. if you strated since the experiment finished...]. Since then we've been working on what else we might be able to tell from sensing other things.

As a precursor it's important to remember that we almost never care about what we're sensing directly. Only what we can infer about something else by looking at the sensor data. An example might be heart rate. If it jumps from 60 beats per minute to 180 bpm (acording to a heart rate monitor) then all the sensor has told us is that your pulse has spiked[1. actually it's actually only told us about electrical activity in your chest.], we're left to speculate about why. Did a tigerstart chasing you? Did you meet the love of your life? The heart rate data alone can't tell us. We need a context, and more data sets/sources gives us more context.

The main motivation for sensing is to understand the world better. In our case to understand our tiny corner of the world i.e. the Sydney studio[1. Understanding the Sydney studio is actally a prototype for understanding more of the world]. There are two main goals. One is to understand how workplaces work, the other is specifically focused on how _we_ work.

The broad goal helps us design better workplaces for others. We realise that we (BVN) are different to a lot of our clients, so anything we learn isn't _completely_ transferrable. My assumption is---and I need to test this---that we're more similar than we imagine[1. A bit liek our similarity to chimps...]. That similarity makes what we learn transferrable. In the short term, instrumenting our workplace alows us to prototype the method of instrumenting other workplaces, which will give us an answer to the <q>how different</q> question.

Part two, understanding how _we_ work gives us the insights that katerine has talked so pasionately about. We'll be able to understad what it is that we do well, and position ourselves to make the most of these skills and attributes. This is really important in the comming onslaught of automation [1. link to mongol post]. There are two possible responses to it and understanding what it is that we do that is a genuine value add, rather than a supporting character, positions us well to survive the transition to a thriving position in the new economy.


## After that introduction, what do we actually want to sense?

We're looking at three main packages, stick based, desk based and sky based. Or, if you like cool names:

1. the Sensicorn Stampede Stick (or S³)---stick based
2. the Phreak Guardian---desk based
3. The Big Boo---sky based

These are all working titles, so if you've got a better one, then sound off in the comments.

# S³

The S³ is a small and cheap environmental sensor. It has a temperature, sound and light sensor. It also has a very nice colour changing LED that can be driven by the user's computer. The important thing about it being cheap is that it's possible to get incredible densities of them. That gives really good spatial resolution to the environmental data. They are about 1/10th [fix frac] of the price of comparible sensors currently available, and also have a way of giving the user feedback about their word through the LEDs. That could be about the bhysical environment, or it could notify about anything that can be connected to IFTTT[1. explain it]. This is part of my ethical position on not taking without giving back; it's only a small gesture, but I'd love to be able to pop up a red light to tell people that I'm in focus mode.

The way we're going to get the cost down is through manufacturing volume. 10 of them will cost [X] each to make, but 1000 will cost [Y] each to make. We're going to derisk that through kickstarter.

# Phreak Guardian

This package does two things. One is to give individuals control and visibility of their electricity usage. Two is to give us a better idea of occupant behaviour.
