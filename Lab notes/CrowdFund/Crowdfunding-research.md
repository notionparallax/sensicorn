## How much do hardware startups get?

### video
A really good video!
[e.g.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/802007522/up-core-the-smallest-quadcore-x86-single-board-com?ref=category_popular)
## Shipping
- need to ship around the world


## Pitfalls

### Shipping hardware is hard
prototyping, tooling and supply chains

get all components in a clear well know supply chain:
know EXACTLY what and when it will come.
otherwise you will not deliver your product

Don't jump the gun, have your product, not a nice prototype

DOn't use thin markups

[Flic failure](https://community.flic.io/topic/16/the-first-batch-a-lesson-learnt-about-hardware-and-early-assumptions) to add firmware update (FUTURE PROOF IT!)

lack of an engaging story -> show them you have a good marketing strategy
