# Future Design Considerations

## MCU
- [nRF51822](https://statics3.seeedstudio.com/images/opl/datasheet/310060026.pdf) arm cortex m0 and BLE only $1.6 with seeed.
- ATSAMR21

Consider using a wireless communication system other than Wifi to network devices and collect sensor data with lower overheads.

Consider multiple nodes and 1 base station


### Crystal
32.768 kHz crystal used to synchronise chip
used as RTC?

## RGB LED
- WS2812 (neopixel) much cheaper than dotstar 2020

## Mems Mic
[using digital mems mic - adafruit](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-i2s-mems-microphone-breakout.pdf)
requires 3V3 power!
compare analgoue and atmega with digital and M0 in terms of price!
