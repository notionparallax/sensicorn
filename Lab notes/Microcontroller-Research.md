# Microcontroller Research
It's time to get real and write it all in C (f%$@ off IDE)

## TIME STAMP raspberry-pi-setup

## Look into
### V-USB vs Driver specific
### Real time OS/need for an OS
An OS may be useful rather than direct hardware
[ChibiOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChibiOS/RT)
it is compatible with megaAVR
freeRTOS (probably too heavy)

[a comparison of open source OSs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_operating_systems )
### USB specific
application specific AVR (USB)

### Communication protocols
multi threading
multi tasking
scheduling
queues/priority

CAN bus (Controller Area Network)
