## Colour Temperature
White light colour temperature is measured in Kelvin
it range from 2700K (warm) to 6000 K (cool)

The classic incandescent lightbulb sits on the warm end of the spectrum (the yellow).
This is the preferred temperature in general.

## Brightness
- The easiest comparable light measurement is LUMENS
### LUMENS
A Lumen is the unit for _luminous flux_
lumens is a measure of total quantity of **visible light**.
Thus it is weighted according to a model (a "luminosity function") of the human eye's sensitivity to various wavelengths.

The number of lumens from a source also depends on its spectrum ("Color temperature"). See luminosity funciton.
#### Lux
1 lux = 1 lumen/m^2. ->
thus it is distance dependent


## Luminosity function
As described above, a luminosity function (LumFun) is a model used to describe the average spectral sensitivity of human visual perception of brightness.

### functions
There are two common luminosity functions.
the _photopic_ LumFun is the best approximation for everyday.
the _scotopic_ LumFun is used for low lighting levels.

Photopic LumFun is wavelength dependent

### LED Physics

## LED power cost


# Colour Temperature Control
- Separate RGB and White LED strips, with W determining the brightness and RGB the temperature
- 3 channel W with cool to warm Lights
- RGBW by itself
- analogue Strips (cheap and simple) cannot control individual LED (colour equal for all LEDs), this is the PWM method



# Products
- use aluminium PCB
- surface mount
- other heat sinking
